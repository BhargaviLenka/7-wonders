                        The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World (from left to right, top to bottom): Great Pyramid of Giza, Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, Statue of Zeus at Olympia, Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (also known as the Mausoleum of Mausolus), Colossus of Rhodes, and the Lighthouse of Alexandria as depicted by 16th-century Dutch artist Maarten van Heemskerck. <br> <br>

                        Various lists of the Wonders of the World have been compiled from antiquity to the present day, in order to catalogue the world's most spectacular natural features and human-built structures. <br> <br>
                        
                        The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the oldest known list of this type, documenting the most remarkable man-made creations of classical antiquity; it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic sightseers and as such only includes works located around the Mediterranean rim and in the ancient Near East. The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty, and because it reflected the number of planets known in ancient times (five) plus the Sun and Moon.[1] Many similar lists have been made for other regions of the world or for the entire world, or which include natural wonders instead of man-made structures.
                        In the 19th and early 20th centuries, some writers emulated the classical list by creating their own lists with names such as "Wonders of the Middle Ages", "Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages", "Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind", and "Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages".[2] It is unlikely that any of these lists actually originated in the Middle Ages, especially considering that the word "medieval" was not invented until the Enlightenment era and the concept of a "Middle Age" did not become popular until at least the 16th century. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable refers to them as "later list[s]",[3] suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages.

                        Many of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Middle Ages but were well known throughout the world.[4][5] Typically representative of such lists are:[3][4][6][7] <br><br>
                        Taj Mahal, a 17th-century mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the city of Agra, India. <br>
                        Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa, a 2nd-century funerary complex in Alexandria, Egypt.
                        Colosseum, a 1st-century amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.
                        Great Wall of China, a series of defensive fortifications built across the historical northern borders of China, with some segments dating to as early as the 7th century BC.
                        Hagia Sophia, a 6th-century cathedral and mosque in Istanbul, Turkey.
                        Leaning Tower of Pisa, a 12th-century bell tower in Pisa, Italy.
                        Porcelain Tower of Nanjing, a 15th-century pagoda on the south bank of the external Qinhuai River in Nanjing, People's Republic of China. <br><br>
                        Stonehenge, a Neolithic henge monument in Wiltshire, England dated to the 3rd millennium BC.
                        Other structures sometimes included on such lists include:

                        Cairo Citadel, a 13th-century Islamic fortification in Cairo, Egypt.[8]
                        Cluny Abbey, a 10th-century Benedictine monastery in Cluny, Sa√¥ne-et-Loire, France.[9]
